# 13-ORM-E-Commerce-Platform

## Description
This project was created to learn how to utilize ORM with a e-commerce platform. This database keeps information on the products, tags, and categories that are within it. I learned how to use CRUD and create routes to get information, add, update, or delete data that is in the database. 

## Installation
NA

## Usage
To use this, you will need to run node server.js to get the App to listen on the port. Open insomnia and go to the folder that you want to make changes to or get info from. Here is a snip of how to GET the Tags information.
